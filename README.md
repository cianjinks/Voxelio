## Building from Source

Before building you will first have to clone this project. However, it contains some submodules so please use:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/cianjinks/Voxelio

Voxelio uses [premake](https://premake.github.io/) to build. This makes it incredibly easy to build for any IDE or system you like using a simple premake binary. I encourage you to check out their documentation on how to use it.

### Windows

Simply download and run `win_premake.bat` and it will generate a visual studio 2019 project for windows. If you wish to generate for other IDE's simply modify the bat file according to premakes documentation.

### Linux/MacOS

I currently build just for windows but as mentioned above, I would appreciate if someone could test building on and for Linux and MacOS. Premake should support this easily so let me know your findings!
